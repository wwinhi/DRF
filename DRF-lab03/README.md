   python -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```

9. Open the browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the app running.

### Configuration

- **Database**: The default configuration uses SQLite, but you can update `settings.py` to use PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other databases.
- **Static files**: Run `python manage.py collectstatic` when deploying to handle static files.

### Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Deployment

For production, ensure you do the following:

- Use a production-ready database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Set `DEBUG = False` in `settings.py`.
- Configure allowed hosts.
- Set up a proper WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn) and a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx).
